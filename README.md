# Cyber-SEcurity-Capstone
### Reconnaissance:
 How did you identify the target?

 What tools did you use to identify that the target was vulnerable?

 If you were a real attacker what would make this an appealing target to hack? 

How would the business be affected if you were to attack this infrastructure?

### Vulnerabilities Address the following questions in your presentation:

How did you recognize this virtual machine was vulnerable?

Were there any other vulnerabilities that you saw?

What would you do to fix what you exploited?

### Attack Methods Address the following questions in your presentation:

What tools did you use to bypass the security?

How did you know those would work?

Would they work in the real world?

What would you recommend to your clients?

### Post Exploitation Address the following questions in your presentation:

When you were in the machine, what user were you?

Did you have access to the full machine?

How would you be able to defend against this exploit?

What would you do to maintain access to the server?

### Incident Response Address the following questions in your presentation:

What time did the attack start and how long did it last?

What was the IP address of the attacker?

Who was the attacker trying to login as?

Was the attacker successful?

How many passwords did the attacker use before they found the correct password?

What kind of attack was the attacker using? 

How is this reflected in the report?

## Mediation Address the following questions in your presentation:

How would you protect your servers from these attacks?

Are there any other vulnerabilities that the server would be prone to?

What are they?

How would you fix those?

#### Objectives:
On your Kali machine, use Wireshark to open the Snort log.


### Look through the data and answer the following questions according to Wireshark:


How long did the attack last?


How many password attempts were made?


In which packet was the correct password found?


In which packet was the shell placed onto the server?


In which packet was the shell activated?
